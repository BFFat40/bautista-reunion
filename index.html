                  <p class="body-text">
                    Nobody knows the Bautista nose better than a Bautista.

A defining characteristic of a Bautista is the nose. When a new born Bautista grandchild is first viewed in the nursery, the foremost question is “Does the baby have the Bautista nose?”

Another characteristic of a Bautista is brains. Brains and nose invariably come together in a Bautista, so much so that Gigi Rapadas wonders if the nose contains some of the Bautista’s prodigious brains.

There is of course no scientific basis for Gigi’s hypothesis. I have a different theory based on the following irrefutable facts (according to Wikipedia).

1.    The brain consumes the most energy among all the organs in a human body therefore generating a lot of heat.
2.    A brain that is overheated loses efficiency. This is the reason that a high fever may cause convulsions or delusions.
3.    The nose is an important part of the body’s cooling mechanism. A dog’s nose is always wet because it aids in cooling.
4.    People who evolved in the tropics have wide flat noses because these aid in cooling the body. Conversely, people who evolved in colder climes have thin high noses because such noses aid in heat retention.

Ergo, the Bautista nose is a necessary appendage that helps to cool the hyperactive Bautista brain. In other words, the Bautista knows because of the Bautista nose.

Oh, the question asked was, Why do I love being a Bautista? My answer: the Bautista sense of humor.

                  <p class="body-text">
                   It was fun growing up in Tuguegarao despite the fact that we had no electricity at all. But we managed to live well.

For leisure and fun we usually went to the movies, went on joy rides on Saturdays and went swimming at the Peñablanca River. We enjoyed picnics with our rice wrapped in banana leaves. We also had trips to Callao Cave and rode the banca and it was a must to get wet under the waterfall “mororan”.

Who can forget the joy ride in the calesa around the Calle Comercio?

These simple things made us so happy.

And come summertime, some of our cousins from Manila came to visit us and we let them experience the things like making our own kites and having a dog fight with our friends and if there was a moon we played St. Peter and kick the can.

We brought them to Peñablanca for picnics and to Callao Cave for a boat ride and visit to the chambers.

December 26 was our town fiesta and it was another occasion to be together with the Bautistas and enjoy the abundance of food.

And lastly a visit to Our Lady of Piat was a part of our life, whether to pay homage to Our Lady or hear Sunday mass.

And after mass of course we would buy suman in a bamboo shell and patupat

What lovely memories…

                    When Felix was courting me, I told my friends about him and they said, “Aren’t you afraid of marrying him? He has seven sisters and, worse, a stepmother. Imagine, seven sisters-in-law. It’s a scary situation.” But I was young (19) and foolish and terribly smitten. The next year, I married him. I married the man, not the name. To borrow Shakespeare’s famous line, “Felix, by any other name, would smell as sweet.” From the alphabetical point of view, though, I moved up from S (Syquia) to B (Bautista).
